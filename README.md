# FeastFreedom

Feast Freedom is a food service site for where restaurants upload menu items and users can order food off local menus.
After a restaurant registers, they are able to add multiple menu items to their menu. When they log into their account, 
they are able to view their menu, add more items to their menu, as well as delete items from their menu.

Unfortunately, website only exists on localhost for right now.
